- ## About
This thesis focuses on the analysis, design and implementation of a 3D 
serious game, which aims to simulate the evacuation of educational institutions in 
three different cases of natural disasters, which include fire, earthquake and flood.
In more detail, this serious game was created using the Unity platform, which 
offers many possibilities and tools. It aims to inform elementary and high school 
students about the risks of natural disasters, as well as learning the evacuation
protocols, using specialized questions, so that they can properly react and behave
in the corresponding conditions. For better user interaction with the program, 
positive and negative feedback techniques were integrated, as well as game 
creation models were followed with the intention of creating an accessible space, 
which would have as its final goal the interactive and effective education of students.
This serious game provides the potential for representation and creation of
any educational institution, thereby making the user experience more personalized 
and creating opportunities for better evacuation simulation and student learning. 
Finally, this thesis elaborates on the methodologies followed to complete the 
research project and it also presents the architecture of the serious game, which 
includes the static scenes and the levels through which the users are able to 
examine their knowledge.
